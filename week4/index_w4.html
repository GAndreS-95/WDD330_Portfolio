    <h3><em>Forms</em></h3>
    <p>
        Forms are the most common method of interacting with a web page. A form is the main component of Google s home page, and most of us use forms every day to log into our favorite sites. Forms are made up of a < form > element that contains form controls such as input fields, select menus, and buttons. The form can be filled in by a user and is then submitted to a URL where it is processed on a server.
        <br>
        Each form control has an initial value that is specified in the HTML code and a current value. The current value can be changed by a user entering information or interacting with the form s interface (such as using a slider). Values in a form can also be changed dynamically using JavaScript.
        <br>
        When a form is submitted, it s sent to a server where the information is processed using a back end language such as PHP or Ruby. It s possible to process the information in a form on the front end before it is sent to the server using JavaScript
    </p>

    <h3><em>Accessing Form Elements</em></h3>
    <p>
        The legacy DOM had a useful method called document.forms that returns an HTML collection of all the forms in the document in the order that they appear in the markup. Even though there is only one form in our example, a collection will still be returned, so we have to use index notation to return the first (and only) form object.
        <br>
        Be careful referencing elements in this way, however. If the form had the same name as any properties or methods of the document.forms object, such as "submit" for example, that property or method would be referenced instead of the form element.
        <br>
        To avoid this, the square bracket notation can be used (this is also useful if the form s name attribute contains any invalid characters, such as spaces or dashes)
    </p>

    <h3><em>Form Properties and Methods</em></h3>
    <p>
        Form objects have a number of useful properties and methods that can interact with the form.
        <br>
        The form.submit() method will submit the form automatically. Note that submitting a form using this method won t trigger a form "submit" event; that is covered in the next section.
        <br>
        A form can be submitted manually by the user employing a button or input element with a type attribute of submit, or even an input element with a type attribute of image:
        <br>
        < button type="submit">Submit >
        <br>
        < input type="submit" value="Submit" >
        <br>
        < input type="image" src="button.png" >
        <br>
        The form.reset() method will reset all the form controls back to their initial values specified in the HTML.
        <br>
        A button with the type attribute of reset can also be used to do this without the need for additional scripting:< button type="reset">Reset</>
    </p>

    <h3><em>Password Input Fields</em></h3>
    <p>
        input type="password" is used to enter passwords or secret information. This works in the same way as an input field with type="text", except that the characters are concealed as they are entered so they re unable to be read on the screen.
