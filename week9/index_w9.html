    <h1><em>The Browser Object Model</em></h1>
    <p>
        The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and
        methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen. For ex
        ample, we can find out which browser the users are utilising (though, this method
        is unreliable), the dimensions of their screens, and which pages they have visited
        before the current page. It can also be used for the rather dubious practice of creating
        pop-up windows, if youâ€™re into annoying your users. <br>
        There is no official standard for the BOM, although there are a number of properties
        and methods that are supported by all the major browsers, making a sort of de facto
        standard. These properties and methods are made available through the window
        object. Every browser window, tab, popup, frame, and iframe has a window object.
    </p>

    <h3><em>Avoid Popups!</em></h3>
        <p>
            These methods were largely responsible for giving JavaScript a bad name as they
            were used for creating annoying pop-up windows. It's also a bad idea from a us
            ability standpoint to resize or move a user's window.
            Many browsers block pop-up windows and disallow some of these methods to be
            called in certain cases. For example, you canâ€™t resize a window if more than one
            tab is open.
            Itâ€™s rare that it would be sensible to use any of these methods, so think very care
            fully before using them. There will almost always be a better alternative, and a
            ninja will find it.
        </p>

    <h3><em>Scaling</em></h3>
    <p>The scale(x,y) function scales an elementbythe defined factors horizontallythen
        vertically. If only one value is provided, it will be used for both the x and y values,
        growingor shrinkingyour elementor pseudo-element while maintaining theoriginal
        aspect ratio. For example, scale(1) would leave the element the same size, scale(2)
        would double its proportions, scale(0.5) would halve them, and so on.</p>

    <h3><em>Rotation</em></h3>
    <p>
        The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified
        angle value. As with scale, by default the point of origin is the elementâ€™s center.
        Generally, angles are declared in degrees, with positive degrees moving clockwise
        and negative moving counterclockwise. In addition to degrees, values can be
        provided in grads, radians, or turns.
    </p>

    <h3><em>Skew</em></h3>
    <p>
        The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes. As you'd expect,
        the x specifies the skew on the x axis, and the y specifies the skew on the y axis. If
        the second parameter is omitted, the skew will only occur on the x axis.
    </p>

    <h3><em>Transitions</em></h3>
    <p>
        Transitions allow the values of CSS properties to change over time, essentially
        providing simple animations. For example, if a link changes color on hover, you
        can have it gradually fade from one color to the other instead of a sudden change.
        Theyâ€™re both transitions, but with the CSS transition property the color transition
        can be gradual. If the browser lacks support for transitions, the change will be immediate instead of gradual, which is fine and accessible.
    </p>

    <h3><em>Animations</em></h3>
    <p>
        Transitions animate elements over time; however, theyâ€™re limited in what they can
        do. You can define starting and ending states, but thereâ€™s no fine-grained control
        over any intermediate states. CSS animations, unlike transitions, allow you to
        control each step of an animation via keyframes.
    </p>

    <h3><em>Keyframes</em></h3>
    <p>
        To animate an element in CSS, you first create a named animation, then attach it
toan element in that elementâ€™s property declaration block. Animations in themselves
donâ€™t do anything; in order to animate an element, youâ€™ll need to associate the an
imation with that element.

    </p>
    <p>Each keyframe looks like its own nested CSS declaration block. Instead of a tradi
        tional selector, though, you use a percentage value, or a comma-separated list of
        percentage values. There are two keytermsâ€•from and toâ€•which evaluate to 0%
        and 100% respectively. These values specify how far along the animation each
        keyframe is located.</p>
    <p>Inside each keyframe include the properties you want to animate, along with the
        animated values. The values will be smoothly interpolated by the browserâ€™s anima
        tion engine between each keyframe.<br>

        Keyframes can be specified in any order; itâ€™s the percentage values rather than the
        order of the declarations that determine the sequence of keyframes in the animation.</p>
