    <h4><em>Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings</em></h4>
    <p>
        As programmers, we often have little influence over how external systems work, so it can be difficult to fix the root cause of system errors. Despite this, we should still try to catch them and attempt to reduce their impact by working around the problems they cause. Programmer errors are our responsibility, so we must ensure they are minimized as much as possible and fixed promptly. We also should try to limit user errors by predicting any possible interactions that may throw an error, and ensure they are dealt with in a way that doesn't t negatively affect the user expertience.<br>
        <br>
        When an error occurs in JavaScript, an exception is thrown that will cause the program to terminate. For example, trying to call a method that is nonexistent will result in an exception:<br>
        <br>
        document.unicorn();<br>
        << TypeError: document.unicorn is not a function
    </p>
    <p>
        An exception will also produce a stack trace. It is often not just a single function or method call that causes an error, but a sequence of function and method calls. A stack trace will work backwards from the point at which the error occurred to identify the original function or method that started the sequence.<br>
        <br>
        JavaScript will also show a warning if there is an error in the code that fails to stop the program from running. This means that the program will continue to run after a warning; this can be problematic, though, since the issue that produced the warning may cause the program to run incorrectly.
    </p>
    <p>
        An example of a mistake that causes a warning is assigning a value to a variable that's undeclared:<br>
        <br>
        pi = 3.142;<br>
        << JavaScript Warning: assignment to undeclared variable<br>        
        <br>
        Warnings and exceptions are presented differently in various browser environments. Some of them will show a small icon in the corner of the browser window to indicate that an exception or warning has occurred, whereas others require the console to be open to see any warnings or exceptions.<br>
        <br>      
        When an exception occurs, the HTML will still appear but the JavaScript code will stop working, which isn t always obvious. If a warning occurs, the JavaScript will continue to run (although possibly incorrectly).
    </p>

    <h4><em>Debugging in the browser</em></h4>
    <p><strong>Debugging</strong> is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and then dealing with them. In many cases, the point at which an error occurs is not always where it originated, so you'll need to run through the program to see what s happening at different stages of its execution. When doing this, it can be useful to create what are known as <strong>breakpoints</strong>, which halt the progress of the code and allow us to view the value of different variables at that point in the program. There are a number of options for debugging JavaScript code in the browser.</p>

    <h4><em>Using the console</em></h4>
    <p>Most modern browsers have a console object that provides a number of methods for logging information and debugging. It is not part of the official ECMAScript specification, but is well supported in all the major browsers.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The console.log() method can be used to log the value of variables at different stages of the program, although it will not actually stop executing the program.
        </li>
        <li>The console.trace() method will log an interactive stack trace in the console. This will show the functions that were called in the lead up to an exception occurring while the code is running.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4><em>Error Objects</em></h4>
    <p>
        An error object can be created by the host environment when an exception occurs, or it can be created in the code using a constructor function, like so:<br>
        <br>
        var error = new Error();<br>
        <br>       
        This constructor function takes a parameter that's used as the error message:<br>
        <br>
        error = new Error("Oops, something went wrong");
    </p>
    <p><em>Ther are six more error objects used for specific errors</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>EvalError is not used in the current ECMAScript specification and only retained for backwards compatibility. It was used to identify errors when using the global eval() function.</li>
        <li>RangeError is thrown when a number is outside an allowable range of values.</li>
        <li>ReferenceError is thrown when a reference is made to an item that doesn't exist. For example, try calling the function unicorn() in the console (assuming you haven't defined a function called unicorn()).</li>
        <li>SyntaxError is thrown when there s an error in the code's syntax.</li>
        <li>TypeError is thrown when there s an error in the type of value used; for example, a string is used when a number is expected.</li>
        <li>URIError is thrown when there s a problem encoding or decoding the URI. These error functions can also be used as constructors to create custom error objects:<br>
        error = new TypeError("You need to use numbers in this function")</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All error objects have a number of properties, but they are often used inconsistently across browsers. The only properties that are generally safe to use are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The name property returns the name of the error constructor function used as a string, such as "Error" or "ReferenceError".</li>
        <li>The message property returns a description of the error and should be provided as an argument to the Error constructor function.</li>
        <li>The stack property will return a stack trace for that error.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4><em>Test-driven Development</em></h4>
    <p>Test-driven development (TDD) is the process of writing tests before any code. Obviously, these tests will initially fail, because there is no code. The next step is to write some code so that the tests pass. After this the code is refactored to make it more readable, faster, and remove repetition. This process should be followed in small piecemeal chunks every time a new feature is implemented. It gives the fol lowing workflow:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>write tests (that initially fail)</li>
        <li>write code to pass the tests</li>
        <li>refactor the code</li>
        <li>write more tests for new features</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This is often referred to as the "red-green-refactor" cycle of TDD, as failing tests usually show up as red and tests that pass show as green.</p>
