    <h2>Variables</h2>
    <p><em>Variables store value in memory for specific uses in JavaScript. Use keywords like var, let, and const to use variables. Naming variables can start with any upper/lower case letters, underscores, or dollar symbols. It can contain numbers but can't start w/ them. Variables are also very case sensitive.</em></p>

    <h3><em>Reserved Words</em></h3>
    <p>They are words in JavaScript that are reserved and thus can't be named with such words.</p>

    <h3><em>Assignment</em></h3>
    <p> Assigning values to a variable is done by using the [ = ] operator. <br>
        We can also declare and initialize a variable at the same time. <br>
        i.e. let name = "Howard";
    </p>

    <p>We use the dot [ . ] operator followed by the name of the method, followed by parentheses to call methods. <br>
        <br>
        i.e. <br>
        name.toUpperCase(); --- Changes object to all upper case letters. <br>
        name.toLowerCase(); --- Changes object to all lower case letters.
    </p>
    
    <p>Bracket Notation can also be used to access a primitive value's properties using the square brackets '[ ]' <br>
    <br>
    i.e. name.length; <br>
    >>> 10</p>

    <h3><em>Exponential Notation</em></h3>
    <p>
        i.e. <br>
        <br>
        1e6 --- 1 multiplied by 10 to the power of 6 <br>
        << 1000000 <br>
        <br>
        2E3 --- <br>
        << 2000 <br>
        <br>
        2.5e-3 --- 2.5 multiplied by 10 to the power of -3 <br>
        << 0.0025
    </p>

    <h3><em>Number Methods</em></h3>
    <p>Numbers also have some built-in methods, although you need to be careful when using the dot notation with number literals that are integers because the dot can be confused for a decimal point. [either use two dots, add a space, write the integer as a decimal, or place the integer in parentheses]<br>
    <br>
    'toFixed( )' -  this method rounds a number to a fixed number of decimal places.<br>
    <br>
    'toPrecision( )' - this method rounds a number to a fixed number of significant figures that is returned as a string.</p>

    <h3><em>NaN</em></h3>
    <p>NaN is an error value that is short for "Not a Number". It is used when an operation is attempted and the result is not numerical.</p>

    <h2>Converting strings to numbers & vice versa</h2>

    <h4><em>Strings to Numbers</em></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Coercion -- multiply a numerical string by 1.</li>
        <li>Place a [+] symbol in front of the numerical string.</li>
        <li>Number function -- This is the preferred way to convert strings into numbers as it avoids type coercion in the background. The conversion is explicit, making it obvious what is being done.
        <br>
        <em>ie. Number("23");</em>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4><em>Numbers to Strings</em></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Adding numbers to empty stings
            <br>
            <em>i.e. 3 + ' ';</em></li>
        <li>String function -- most preferred method.
            <br>
            <em>i.e. String(3);</em></li>
        <li>toString( ) method.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><em>Parsing Numbers</em></h3>
    <p>The function parseInt( ) can be used to convert a numerical string into an integer.</p>



    <h2>Array Properties and Methods</h2>
    <p><em>Arrays are a powerful weapon in a JavaScript ninja s toolkit and have some useful methods.</em></p>

    <h3><em>Pop, Push, Shift, and Unshift</em></h3>
    <p>To remove the last item from an array, we can use the pop() method.
        <br>
        The push() method appends a new value to the end of the array.
        <br>
        The unshift() method is similar to the push() method, but this appends a new item to the beginning of the array.</p>

    <h3><em>Merging Arrays</em></h3>
    <p>The concat() method can be used to merge an array with one or more arrays:
    <br>
    Note that this does not change the array, it simply creates another array combining the two arrays. You can use assignment to change the pizzas array to this new array.</p>

    <h3><em>The join() Method</em></h3>
    <p>The join() method can be used to turn the array into a string that comprises all the items in the array, separated by commas.
    <br>
    You can choose a separator other than a comma by placing it inside the parentheses.</p>
    
    <h3><em>Slicing and Splicing</em></h3>
    <p>The slice() method creates a subarray, effectively chopping out a slice of an original array starting at one index and finishing at the next. </p>
    <p>
        Note that this operation is non-destructive -- no items are actually removed from the array.
        <br>
        The splice() method removes items from an array and then inserts new items in their place. 
        <br>
        The splice() method can also be used to insert values into an array at a specific index without removing any items, by indicating that zero items are to be removed
        <br>
        If you want to remove a value completely, you can use the splice() method with a length of 1 and without specifying any values to add.
    </p>

    <h3><em>Reverse</em></h3>
    <p>We can reverse the order of an array using the reverse() method.
        <br>
        Note that this changes the order of the array permanently.</p>

    <h3><em>Sort</em></h3>
    <p>We can sort the order of an array using the sort() method:
        <br>
        It is alphabetical order by default for String objects. Note that this also changes the order of the array permanently.</p>

    <h2>Callbacks</h2>
    <p><em>Remember at the start of this chapter when we said that functions in JavaScript are first-class objects, and this means that they behave in just the same way as every other value? Well, they can also be given as a parameter to another function. A function that is passed as an argument to another is known as a callback.</em></p>
