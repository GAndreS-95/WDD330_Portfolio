    <h1>MASTER MOBILE UX - NOTES</h1>

    <p>1) It's better to write on mobile first. Start small and scale-up. Ensures that we are concentrating on our content and functionality, making sure everything works on smaller screens since more people are on their phones than their desktops or laptops.</p>

    <p>2) Don't listen to what they say, observe on what they're doing and find a way to fill their needs as simple as possible. </p>

    <p>3) SPEED MATTERS</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduce image usage</li>
        <li>SVG/Web-fonts w/ lower bandwidth</li>
        <li>Optimize and minify CSS & JS files</li>
        <li>ZIP unnecessary data</li>
    </ul>

    <p>4) Mobile is a great forcing function for simplicity. The less people think while browsing a website, the longer they can actually stay. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Don't make very long forms and reduce cognitive load. Delete some fields. </li>
        <li>if forms need to be long, add a progress section and include autofill. This will reduce errors and makes it easier for users to navigate through the form. </li>
        <li>When it comes to passwords, always add the show/hide function to reduce cognitive load.</li>
        <li>When inputting CC information, it's best to automate adding spaces to reduce errors. When taking numbers, ensure number keypad is used instead, this make the user think less and provides less errors.</li>
        <li>Don't force users to copy and paste information, if a link can be added to direct them where they need to be (eg. phone numbers, other links) then add them links.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>5) <em>"End-users, not technologies, shape the market. Consequently marketers need to stay abreast not only of technological developments but also of the way people respond to them." --- <strong>Matt Haig</strong></em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Research is key to making user-friendly apps.</li>
        <li>When adding adds in small mobile screens, make them small. It should not take up more than 40% of the space on the screen. They could be made small enough that can still make them effective.</li>

    </ul>

    <h3><em>Potential Design</em></h3>
    <p>add a small window to reveal a full image behind the content.</p>

    <h2>THINGS TO REMEMBER</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Do not use Pop-ups/Pop-overs.</li>
        <li>Users don't visit a website to look at ads.</li>
        <li>Keep it simple and sleek.</li>
        <li>make sure it's unobtrusive. Content first.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Websites should be easy and simple for users to navigate. <em>Empathy is a core when creating UX designs for any application.</em> Failure to keep the user from being frustrated or bored when using the website will result in lower conversions and click-throughs. <strong>AGAIN, KEEP IT SIMPLE. THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX.</strong></h4>
